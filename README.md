# Fixed-Media-queries (FMQ)

Just a simple width reminder on the top of your page.

### Installing
Dowload the ``` fmq.css ``` file and put on your folder project.

Link it on your page and add 
```
<div class="fmq"></div>
```
and you are done!!

### More
Adding the class ``` long ``` the min-width will extend for all the page height.

At moment there is only one : ``` light ``` useful if you are working with dark backgrounds.
